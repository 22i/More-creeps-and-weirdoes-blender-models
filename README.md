a bit of creep history:

Creeps were mostly made by [freakstritch](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1272354-1-2-5-morecreeps-weirdos-v2-62-slot-machines-old) in 2012 and not updated over minecraft 1.2.5 for quite a while. Since then a reboot was started by [Astromojang](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/2506162-more-creeps-and-weirdos-rebooted-for-minecraft-1-8) he made it open source but quit working on it year later. Now the mod has gotten picked up by [RickWeek84](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/2742898-1-10-2-morecreeps-weirdos-reborn-v1-2-beta-creepy) and seems to be updated to the latest version.

But these weirdo creeps should be everywhere thats why they are coming to Blender.
